[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/digitalautonomy/grumble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/digitalautonomy/grumble)


This fork of Grumble was made to make it possible to use the functionality of the server as a pure library. In order to do this, all paths were changed, the package cmd/grumble was renamed to server, and the main function in that package was renamed exampleMain.
